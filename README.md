# Install Rails on Mac

Hopefully you have a recent version of Mac OSX installed.

01. If you have Mavericks (10.9) or Yosemite (10.10), you can install Command Line Tools using this command. Choose to install and follow the prompts.

  In your terminal, type `xcode-select --install`

02. If you have an earlier version of OSX, you will probably need to install Command Line Tools by downloading it from the Apple Developer Downloads site.

  Once you're registered and signed in, you can search for Command Line Tools and download/install the latest version for your OSX version.

03. Check that Command Line Tools have installed

  In your terminal, type `gcc --version`

  You should see a similar output to this:
    ```
    Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
    Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
    Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.2.0
    Thread model: posix
    ```

04. Install HomeBrew
    ```
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

05. When that finishes, run `brew doctor`

06. Install RVM by copying this into your terminal:
    ```
    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    ```

07. Copy the following into the terminal:
    ```
    source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    ```

08. Install the latest Ruby by typing this in your terminal:
    ```
    rvm install 2.3.1
    ```

09. Install Rails

  In your terminal type:
    ```
    rvm use ruby-2.3.1@rails500rc2 --create
    ```

10. Now install the latest Rails:
    ```
    gem install rails --version=5.0.0.rc2 --no-ri --no-rdoc
    ```

  When it's finished, check the version with `rails -v`. It should be 5.0.0.rc2

11. Now set this as the default gemset:
    ```
    rvm use ruby-2.3.1@rails500rc2 --default
    ```

You're done!
